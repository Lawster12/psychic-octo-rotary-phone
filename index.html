            <p>I am a current coding bootcamp student looking for an entry level position in software development. I am looking forward to transitioning from the service industry to software development and using my hard work ethic, dedication and strong communication skills in an environment I am confident I will thrive in. Though I am just beginning, I strongly believe I will be a valuable asset in this field.

            <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
            <p>I had my first introduction to programming in highschool. I took two years of this class and we used mainly Java. The logical thought process and potential that it offered captivated me and there was a time when I wanted to go to university to study computer science. When the pandemic hit I was in my junior year of high school. Taking classes online and not being able to see my classmates for my senior year took all the motivation for college out of me. Instead I decided to work for my father at his restaurant, as I had been working there previously to make some money. I ended up managing the place and found enjoyment in serving our patrons and giving every customer a great experience. Managing a restaurant taught me a lot about communication and the importance of respect, and strong work ethic. I eventually took a look at my life and what I wanted my future to look like. This is why I am dedicating myself to the world of programming. It is long overdue and I can never make up the time that I lost just being comfortable. Searching for a shorter and cheaper option to get back to basics, I found this coding bootcamp and it ticked all the boxes I was looking for. I have had a great time learning how to style a webpage and make something from the ground up that I can be proud of. I have a long way to go but I know Iâ€™ll achieve my dreams given time.</p>
