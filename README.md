# Week 2 challenge AidanBL (Portfolio)

## Description
    This project is my first that I wrote all the code from the ground up. I wanted this site to look, clean and professional and I did as much as I could at my given level of expertise. This was quite challenging and took a lot of time and research to get everything to work the way I wanted it too. There is definitely a lot more that can be done and as I progress through the bootcamp I plan on updating this site until it looks like something I would be proud to show a potential employer.
